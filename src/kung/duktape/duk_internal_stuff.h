	 *  generated code size/speed and alignment/padding; duk_features.h selects

	 *
	 *  Layout 1 (DUK_USE_HOBJECT_LAYOUT_1):
	 *
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_hstring *)         bytes of   entry keys (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_propvalue)         bytes of   entry values (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_uint8_t)           bytes of   entry flags (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    a_size * sizeof(duk_tval)              bytes of   (opt) array values (plain only) (all gc reachable)
	 *    h_size * sizeof(duk_uint32_t)          bytes of   (opt) hash indexes to entries (e_size),
	 *                                                      0xffffffffUL = unused, 0xfffffffeUL = deleted
	 *
	 *  Layout 2 (DUK_USE_HOBJECT_LAYOUT_2):
	 *
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_propvalue)         bytes of   entry values (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_hstring *)         bytes of   entry keys (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_uint8_t) + pad     bytes of   entry flags (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    a_size * sizeof(duk_tval)              bytes of   (opt) array values (plain only) (all gc reachable)
	 *    h_size * sizeof(duk_uint32_t)          bytes of   (opt) hash indexes to entries (e_size),
	 *                                                      0xffffffffUL = unused, 0xfffffffeUL = deleted
	 *
	 *  Layout 3 (DUK_USE_HOBJECT_LAYOUT_3):
	 *
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_propvalue)         bytes of   entry values (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    a_size * sizeof(duk_tval)              bytes of   (opt) array values (plain only) (all gc reachable)
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_hstring *)         bytes of   entry keys (e_next gc reachable)
	 *    h_size * sizeof(duk_uint32_t)          bytes of   (opt) hash indexes to entries (e_size),
	 *                                                      0xffffffffUL = unused, 0xfffffffeUL = deleted
	 *    e_size * sizeof(duk_uint8_t)           bytes of   entry flags (e_next gc reachable)
	 *
	 *  In layout 1, the 'e_next' count is rounded to 4 or 8 on platforms
	 *  requiring 4 or 8 byte alignment.  This ensures proper alignment
	 *  for the entries, at the cost of memory footprint.  However, it's
	 *  probably preferable to use another layout on such platforms instead.
	 *
	 *  In layout 2, the key and value parts are swapped to avoid padding
	 *  the key array on platforms requiring alignment by 8.  The flags part
	 *  is padded to get alignment for array entries.  The 'e_next' count does
	 *  not need to be rounded as in layout 1.
	 *
	 *  In layout 3, entry values and array values are always aligned properly,
	 *  and assuming pointers are at most 8 bytes, so are the entry keys.  Hash
	 *  indices will be properly aligned (assuming pointers are at least 4 bytes).
	 *  Finally, flags don't need additional alignment.  This layout provides
	 *  compact allocations without padding (even on platforms with alignment
	 *  requirements) at the cost of a bit slower lookups.
	 *
	 *  Objects with few keys don't have a hash index; keys are looked up linearly,
	 *  which is cache efficient because the keys are consecutive.  Larger objects
	 *  have a hash index part which contains integer indexes to the entries part.
	 *
	 *  A single allocation reduces memory allocation overhead but requires more
	 *  work when any part needs to be resized.  A sliced allocation for entries
	 *  makes linear key matching faster on most platforms (more locality) and
	 *  skimps on flags size (which would be followed by 3 bytes of padding in
	 *  most architectures if entries were placed in a struct).
	 *
	 *  'props' also contains internal properties distinguished with a non-BMP
	 *  prefix.  Often used properties should be placed early in 'props' whenever
	 *  possible to make accessing them as fast a possible.
